<h1>Resolving Tickets in osTicket</h1>
In this lab, I walk through the entire lifecycle of a ticket, from intake to resolution, using the open-source help desk ticketing system osTicket.<br />

<h2>Lifecycle Stages</h2>

To create tickets, users must first access the ticket portal and log in if needed. Once in the portal, they can submit a ticket request and provide details about their IT-related issues. In this case, I’ve created three tickets that describe a variety of problems commonly seen in a real environment. Tickets are generated by selecting a Help Topic, providing a brief description of the issue, and including the details, all written as if they were an email.

From the admin’s perspective, ticket requests will appear in their panel once submitted. The admins can then reassign tickets to the appropriate agent or team. The severity of the issue is assessed and assigned to ensure that tickets are addressed within the defined SLA. In this case, Jane reviewed the ticket, assigned it to the System Administrators, and changed the severity level to Emergency to prioritize its resolution.

Effective communication is key when resolving tickets. It’s essential to communicate clearly with both the team and the affected users. Tickets can vary in nature and are assigned to the right people based on the issue. For example, one ticket was reassigned from Jane to John, while Jane was able to resolve another ticket on her own. Proper documentation is crucial in creating a successful environment. Each ticket needs to be documented accurately so it can serve as a reference if a similar issue arises in the future.

<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>

The protocols for managing tickets can vary depending on the work environment. There may be specific quotas for how many tickets need to be resolved within a set timeframe, and certain tickets may need to be prioritized based on urgency or impact. By building osTicket from scratch, I gained a deeper understanding of how tickets are handled in an IT role and how to effectively manage and resolve issues within a structured system.
